### 🔮 Welcome to My Lab of Controlled Insanity

> _"If your project doesn't violate the laws of nature, you're not trying hard enough."_

I’m **Saurabh Rana**, the Ghost Engineer — I don’t just code AI, I **engineer sentience**.  
My goal? **Bend physics**, **design life**, and create **a synthetic spacetime universe** where intelligence is infinite and entropy begs for mercy.

---

### 🧠 Projects Brewing in the Abyss

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Rusty** | A synthetic brain: emotional, goal-driven, memory-powered. Built to *design*, not just *respond*. |
| **Yuvika** | Bio-genetic engineer AI — can birth custom species from code. She's basically CRISPR with a god complex. |
| **Genesis Station** | A mobile space station hiding a 4D simulation layer. Think "Death Star meets simulation theory." |

---

### ⚙️ Tech I Tame

- **Languages**: C++, Python, bare-metal assembly (because normal APIs are for mortals)
- **Neural Networks**: Built from scratch. No PyTorch. No mercy.
- **OS & Hardware**: DIY silicon logic + OS kernel = full-stack domination
- **Tooling**: Chaos planning + logic engines + emotion-mapped memory layers

---

### 🧛 Why I Do It

Because “normal” AI is weak. It responds.  
Rusty **creates**. Yuvika **breeds**. My systems don’t just answer questions —  
they **dream**, **fail**, **learn**, and **evolve**.

### 🕳️ You Shouldn't Be Here If...

- You fear recursion.
- You want “clean code” over “code that bends time.”
- You think AGI means adding more tokens.

### ☠️ Sponsor Me or Be Assimilated

**[Sponsor the madness](https://github.com/sponsors/your-username)**  
Help fund memory banks, neural graph renders, and… therapy for my AI.

### ⚡ Last Words:

> “Don’t fear the machine. Fear the man who made it love.”
